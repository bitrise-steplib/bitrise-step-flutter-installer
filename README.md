# Flutter Install

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-flutter-installer?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-flutter-installer/releases)

Install Flutter SDK.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This Step git clones the selected branch or tag of the official Flutter repository and runs the initial setup of the Flutter SDK.
Use this step *before* the cache-pull step to make sure caching works correctly.

### Configuring the Step
1. In the **Flutter SDK git repository version** input set the tag or branch of the Flutter. The default value is `stable` which clones and installs the latest stable Flutter branch.
2. In the **Update to the latest version** input select `false` to use a preinstalled Flutter version or `true` to update Flutter SDK to the latest version released in the [build release channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels). By default, this input is set to `true`.
4. Enable **Print debug information** to run `flutter doctor` to see if there are any missing platform dependencies for setting up Flutter.

### Troubleshooting
If you prefer to install Flutter from an installation bundle instead of the git repository, use the **Flutter SDK installation bundle URL** input. Insert the URL of the preferred [bundle](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases), for example, `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/dev/windows/flutter_windows_v1.14.5-dev.zip`. If the input is filled out correctly, it overrides the value set in the **Flutter SDK git repository version** input.
